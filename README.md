A basic Guttenberg blocks WP plugin created by Deepak.

It has 2 blocks:
- Default block created using create-guten-block.
- Custom block named "MJ Hero Banner" that allows you to upload an hero image and insert it's title and description.

Below you will find some information on how to run scripts.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.
